## Privacy Policy for Echo

**Effective Date: July 17, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how **7venue** ("we," "us," or "our"), located in Germany, collects, uses, and discloses information in connection with your use of the Echo Discord bot ("the Bot").

By adding the Bot to your Discord server or interacting with it, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you don't agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, please don't use the Bot.

### 1. Information We Collect

Echo is designed to provide logging services and analytics for Discord servers. To do this, the Bot collects and processes specific types of information:

- **Server Data:**
  - **Server ID:** To identify the Discord server where the Bot operates.
  - **Channel IDs:** To identify specific channels within a server where events occur or logs are collected.
  - **User IDs:** To identify users linked to specific actions or messages.
  - **Usernames and Discriminators:** To display user information in logs and analytics, as provided by Discord. Keep in mind that Discord's display names can be changed by users.
  - **Timestamps:** To record when events happened.

- **Logging Data (Configurable by Server Owners):**
  - **Message Content:** If your server administrator enables it, the Bot may log message content for moderation, auditing, or record-keeping. **It's the server owner's responsibility to tell their members that message content might be logged and to set up the Bot in line with their server rules and relevant privacy laws.** We don't review or actively monitor logged message content.
  - **User Join/Leave Events:** Records when users join or leave the server.
  - **Channel Creation/Deletion/Update Events:** Records changes made to channels.
  - **Role Creation/Deletion/Update Events:** Records changes made to roles.
  - **Other Server Events:** As supported by Discord's API and the Bot's features (e.g., voice channel activity, ban/unban events).

- **Analytics Data:**
  - **Command Usage:** Aggregated data on which commands are used and how often, usually linked to Server IDs but not directly to identifiable individuals.
  - **Feature Usage:** Data on how frequently specific Bot features are used within servers.
  - **Server Statistics:** General stats like the number of servers the Bot is in, total users, etc.
  - This data is primarily used for our internal analysis to improve the Bot's performance, identify popular features, and understand general usage patterns. It's usually anonymized or aggregated.

**We don't intentionally collect any sensitive personal data** (like health information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, or biometric data) from you or your server members.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The information Echo collects is used only for these purposes:

- **To Provide Bot Functionality:** To enable logging features, store logs, and offer analytical insights to server owners.
- **To Maintain and Improve the Bot:** To fix issues, understand user needs, develop new features, and boost the Bot's overall performance and reliability.
- **To Enforce Terms of Service:** If the Bot is used in a way that violates our Terms of Service (e.g., for malicious activities), collected data might be used to identify and ban offending servers or users.
- **For Internal Analytics:** To track general usage patterns and make data-driven decisions about the Bot's development.

### 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage Location:** All data collected by Echo is stored on secure servers located within the **European Union (EU) or Germany**, in line with GDPR requirements.
- **Security Measures:** We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include, but aren't limited to, encryption, access control, and regular security reviews.
- **Data Retention:**
  - **Logging Data:** Logged data (including message content if enabled) is kept as long as the Bot remains on your server and the data is needed for your server's logging. Server owners can usually manage and delete specific logs or clear all logs using Bot commands. If the Bot is removed from a server, all linked logging data for that server is automatically deleted within a reasonable timeframe (typically 7-30 days to ensure proper unlinking and cleanup).
  - **Analytics Data:** Anonymized or aggregated analytics data might be kept indefinitely for trend analysis and service improvement. Data specifically linked to a server ID for service operation will be removed if the Bot is removed from that server.

### 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We're committed to protecting your privacy. We will **not** sell, rent, or trade your personal data or your server's data with third parties for marketing or commercial purposes.

We might only share information in these limited situations:

- **With Your Consent:** When you give us explicit permission.
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).
- **To Protect Our Rights:** When we believe it's necessary to investigate, prevent, or act regarding potential violations of our Terms of Service, illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to anyone's safety.
- **Anonymized/Aggregated Data:** We may share aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data that can't reasonably be used to identify you or your server members. This might be used for statistics, research, or to publicly report on the Bot's usage (e.g., total servers).
